### Minimum: A* search [0-40] 
1. [10] Find any path between two nodes (could use dfs to make any path between nodes)
2. [10] Find the shortest path (distance or time) between two nodes (Dijkstra from Tutorial 3)
3. [20] Find the shortest path (distance or time) limiting the number of nodes visited by using a distance heuristic

### Core: Components and Connections [40-65]
1. [5] Show differentiation in the components
2. [5] Label the components and displays number of components
3. [5] Minimised the connected components using algorithm to correctly build components in directed multigraph
4. [10] Connect the components with **walking edges**. Adds walking edges to the graph to connect stops with walking edges.

### Complete[75-85]: Time taken
1. [5] Show time taken for the trip
2. [5] Update the A* to use time as the cost rather than distance

### Challenge[85-100]: Fun stuff do something interesting
* [5] Allow time or distance in A* search
* [5] Limit travel by transportation type
* [5] Flexible walking distance calculated within A*
* [5] Implement pin dropping for start and goal points
* [10] Implement an on route stop (ie start to mid then mid to goal)
* [15] Download the Metlink data and implement the Trips and Stoptime to actually use the real data to make a time of Day A*
* ... Other stuff that impresses the marker for the final interesting algorithm or data stucture.
