# COMP261 Assignment 2 A* and Articulation Points

The focus of this assignment is to demonstrate understanding of A* and Articulation Points algorithms.  We will use these to find shortest paths in the Wellington Public Transport network.  This assignment builds on [Assignment 1](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/lms/comp261/2022/ass1) adding searching and interaction with the data.

We will use additional information from [open data at Metlink](https://opendata.metlink.org.nz/).  Assignment 1 used stops.txt and stop_patterns.txt. For the challenge exercises you can download and extract additional information. The files can be downloaded from https://static.opendata.metlink.org.nz/v1/gtfs/full.zip
